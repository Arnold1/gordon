Settings Protocols
====================

When working with settings, static values are sometimes not flexible enough. gordon provides severals protocol which will allow you to
customize your settings.

It is important to understand the difference between :doc:`settings_protocols` and :doc:`parameters_protocols`.
Settings protocols are evaluated on ``build`` time, and parameter_protocols on ``apply``.

On build time there is a limited amount of things we can allow you to customize using protocols. This is because we don't want you
to shoot yourself in the foot.


Reference ``ref://``
---------------------

You can reference parameters using ``ref://NameOfTheParameter`` as value of your setting.

Example:

.. code-block:: yml

    ---
    s3:
      my_s3_integration:
        bucket: ref://MyBucket
        notifications:
          ...
